Beyond my academic research in neuroscience, I maintain a strong interest in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. I closely follow developments in novel therapeutic modalities, emerging drug targets, and the regulatory pathways that shape how new treatments reach patients. Understanding the intersection of scientific innovation and market dynamics offers a unique lens through which to appreciate both the promise and the challenges of translating basic research into clinical impact.

I am particularly drawn to understanding how scientific breakthroughs move through the complex pipeline from bench to bedside—the preclinical validation, clinical trial design, regulatory strategy, and commercial considerations that ultimately determine whether a promising molecule becomes a transformative medicine. This includes tracking trends in areas such as gene therapy, antibody-drug conjugates, targeted protein degradation, and CNS drug development.

I write about these topics on my Substack, [**Downstream Effects**](https://downstreameffects.substack.com/){:target="\_blank"}, where I explore biotech companies, therapeutic mechanisms, and the broader landscape of drug development and healthcare equity.
