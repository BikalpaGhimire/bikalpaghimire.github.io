Welcome!

I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate working in [Xin Huang's lab](https://huanglab.psych.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I received my PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in October 2025, where I worked in the lab of [Xin Huang](https://huanglab.psych.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. Scientifically, I am interested in the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception and communication between cortical areas.

I was born and raised in Nepal and came to the United States after high school for my undergraduate studies. I received my BA in Mathematics and Biology from Minot State University in North Dakota. My early research experience came from working with [Dr. Zeni Shabani](https://www.minotstateu.edu/psych/faculty-staff.shtml){:target="\_blank"}, [Dr. Heidi Super](https://www.minotstateu.edu/bio/faculty-staff.shtml){:target="\_blank"}, and [Dr. Bishnu Sedai](https://www.minotstateu.edu/math/faculty-staff.shtml){:target="\_blank"} in the fields of behavioral/pharmacological neuroscience, cancer biology, and theoretical mathematics, respectively.
