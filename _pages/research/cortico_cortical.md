## Cortico-cortical Interaction for Stable Perception

Finally, I aim to understand how dynamic, recurrent communication between hierarchical brain areas generates a stable visual percept. I am interested in answering how feedback and synergistic interactions between early areas (encoding high-resolution details) and higher areas (encoding global context) resolve sensory noise. My research explores how these resonant circuits refine neural representations over time to maintain a coherent interpretation of the world, even when the input is ambiguous.
