## Perceptual Organization

I am interested in answering how the brain transforms fragmented retinal inputs into a coherent representation of reality. My research explores the neural mechanisms behind perceptual organization—specifically, how the visual system groups discrete sensory elements into unified objects based on statistical regularities like "common fate". I aim to uncover the specific inference processes that allow the brain to decide which local signals belong together and which should be segregated as distinct figures against a background.
