## Direction Repulsion

I am interested in answering how the visual system employs computational strategies to ensure robust segmentation. Specifically, I investigate how mechanisms like direction repulsion exaggerate the angular difference between overlapping signals to reduce ambiguity. My research seeks to explain how neural populations avoid simply averaging conflicting signals and instead "push" perceived directions apart to ensure that distinct objects remain clearly segregated in the final percept.
