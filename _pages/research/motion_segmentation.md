## Motion Segmentation

A central question in my research is how the visual system parses complex dynamic scenes into distinct entities based on differences in velocity. I am particularly focused on understanding how the brain overcomes the physical constraints of receptive fields—the "spatial bottleneck"—to solve the challenge of transparent motion. My goal is to determine the mechanistic rules that dictate whether local motion signals are integrated into a single global flow or preserved as separate, independent surfaces.
