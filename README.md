Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at the **University of Wisconsin-Madison**, affiliated with the **Neuroscience Training Program** and the **Department of Neuroscience**. My research integrates systems and theoretical neuroscience to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception. Specifically, I study how the brain organizes fragmented sensory inputs into coherent perceptual experiences—a process fundamental to perceiving and interpreting the visual world.

Currently my research employs psychophysics, electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates, and computational modeling.
