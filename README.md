### About
I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, affiliated with the Neuroscience Training Program and the Department of Neuroscience. My research integrates systems and theoretical neuroscience to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception. Specifically, I study how the brain organizes fragmented sensory inputs into coherent perceptual experiencesâ€”a process fundamental to perceiving and interpreting the visual world.

Currently my research employs psychophysics, electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates, and computational modeling. By bridging experimental and theoretical approaches, I aim to identify principles of neural coding and circuit dynamics that govern visual processing.
