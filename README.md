Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at the **University of Wisconsin-Madison**, affiliated with the **Neuroscience Training Program** and **Department of Neuroscience**.

My broad research interest lies within systems and theoretical neuroscience. Currently I deploy **human psychophysics, non-human primate electrophysiology, and computational modeling** in my research to study neural mechanism underlying perceptual organization. 

Born and raised in Nepal. Been in states for 10+ years. Outside of research, I enjoy trekking/hiking/camping, motorcycle rides, slopes during winter season, wine nights with friends around the table.
