Hello! I am a PhD candidate in Neuroscience at the **University of Wisconsin-Madison**, affiliated with the **Neuroscience Training Program** and the **Department of Neuroscience**. My research integrates systems and theoretical neuroscience to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying visual perception. Specifically, I study how the brain organizes fragmented sensory inputs into coherent perceptual experiencesâ€”a process fundamental to perceiving and interpreting the visual world.

Currently my research employs psychophysics, electrophysiological recordings in nonhuman primates, and computational modeling.
